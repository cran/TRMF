## Temporally Regularized Matrix Factorization
This package contains a set of functions that factor a time series matrix into a set
of latent time series. Given a time series matrix $A$, alternating least squares is used to estimate the solution to the following equation:

$$\left (X,F\right) = \arg \min \limits_{X_m,F_m \in \Theta} \left( ||W\circ \left(X_m F_m-A \right)||_F+\lambda_f^2 ||F_m||_F + \lambda_x^2 ||X_m||_F + \sum\limits_{s} R_s(X_m)\right)$$
where $W$ is a weighting matrix the same size as $A$ and has 0's where $A$ has missing values. $\Theta$ is a constraint set for $F$, possible values are non-negative solutions, or in the interval $[0,1]$ or non-negative and sum row-wise to 1 for probability-like solutions. 

The last term does the temporal regularization
$$R_s(X) = \lambda_D^2||W_s(LX_s)||_2^2$$
where $L$ is a graph-Laplacian matrix, $X_s$ is a subset of the columns of $X$ and $W_s$ is a diagonal weight matrix. An example of $L$ is a finite difference matrix  $D_{\alpha}$ approximating a derivative of order $\alpha$. In this case, if $\alpha = 2$ then the regularization prefers penalized cubic spline solutions. If $\alpha=1$ then it can be used to fit a random walk.

#### TRMF plus Regression
If necessary, external regressors can be included in matrix factorization by modifying the first term to include the external regressor:

$$\left (X,F\right) = \arg \min \limits_{X_m,F_m \in \Theta} \left( ||W\circ \left(X_m F^{(1)}_m + E_xF^{(2)}_m -A \right)||_F+\lambda_f^2 ||F_m||_F + \lambda_x^2 ||X_m||_F + \sum\limits_{s} R_s(X_m)\right)$$

## How to use
To use the TRMF package to factor a time series matrix:

1. Create TRMF object for your time series matrix 
  ```{r,eval=FALSE}
obj = create_TRMF(A)
```
a. It is recommended to scale the matrix using one of the scaling option in create_TRMF
b. Missing values are imputed as default
  
2. Add a constraint and regularization for $F_m$ to TRMF object
```{r,eval=FALSE}
obj = TRMF_coefficients(obj,reg_type = "nnls",lambda=1)
```
3. Add temporal regularization model for $X_m$ to TRMF object
```{r,eval=FALSE}
obj = TRMF_trend(obj,numTS = 2,order = 2,lambdaD=1)
```
4. Maybe add another temporal regularization model for $X_m$ to TRMF object
```{r,eval=FALSE}
obj = TRMF_trend(obj,numTS = 3,order = 0.5,lambdaD=10)
```

5. Maybe add an external regressor
```{r,eval=FALSE}
obj = TRMF_regression(obj, Xreg, type = "global")
```

6. Train object
```{r,eval=FALSE}
out = train(obj)
```

7. Evaluate solution
```{r,eval=FALSE}
summary(out)
plot(out)
resid(out)
fitted(out)

```

8. Get solution
```{r,eval=FALSE}
impute_TRMF(out)
coef(out)
Fm = out$Factors$Fm
Xm =out$Factors$Xm 
predict(out)

```
