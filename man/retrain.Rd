\title{
Retrain TRMF objects.
}
\description{
Continue training on a pretrained TRMF object.
}
\usage{
retrain(obj, numit, fit_xm_first = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{obj}{Pretrained TRMF object}
  \item{numit}{Number of training iterations}
  \item{fit_xm_first}{Fit the Xm factor first? This could be useful it modifications are made to one of the factors that we don't want to be overwritten.}
}
\details{
This is basically the same function as \code{train()} but it doesn't create any of the constraint matrices and doesn't do any initialization.
}
\value{
A trained TRMF object.
}
